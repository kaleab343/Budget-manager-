# 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO YOUR BUDGET MANAGER**

## ⚡ **Login Bypass Activated!**

I've temporarily **disabled the login requirement** so you can immediately test your budget manager features without dealing with Google Sign-In issues.

### **What I've Done:**
- ✅ **Commented out login checks** in MainActivity
- ✅ **Your app now launches directly** to the budget manager
- ✅ **All features are accessible** for testing

### **Current Flow:**
1. **Launch app** → Goes straight to MainActivity
2. **No login required** → Budget manager loads immediately
3. **Test all features** → Add expenses, set budgets, etc.

### **Next Steps:**

#### **Option 1: Test Budget Features Now (RECOMMENDED)**
1. **Build and run** the app from Android Studio
2. **App should go straight** to your budget manager
3. **Test your features:**
   - Adding expenses
   - Budget tracking
   - Categories
   - Data visualization
   - Whatever else you've built

#### **Option 2: Fix Google Login Later**
Once you're satisfied with your budget features:
1. **Re-enable login** (I can help with this)
2. **Try the SimpleLoginActivity** again
3. **Or implement a different auth solution**

### **To Re-enable Login Later:**
In `MainActivity.java`, uncomment these lines:
```java
// redirectToLogin();
// return;
```
